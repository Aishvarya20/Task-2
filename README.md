Project Description: The Student Grade Tracker is a Java-based program 
designed to help users manage and monitor student grades effectively. The application enables users to input grades for various subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall performance. It also provides additional information such as letter grades or GPA to give a comprehensive view of academic achievement.

Key Features:
Grade Input: Allows users to enter grades for different subjects or assignments.

Average Calculation: Computes the average of the entered grades.
Grade Display: Shows the overall grade along with corresponding letter grades and GPA.

Additional Insights: Provides formatted output to help users understand their academic performance clearly.

Potential Enhancements:
Extended Features: Add support for weighted grades and advanced GPA calculations.

User Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved user interaction.

Data Persistence: Implement data storage options to save and load grade information.

This project provides a practical tool for tracking academic performance and can be further expanded to include more advanced features. I’m grateful for the opportunity to work on this project and for the guidance from my mentor, Muzammil Ahmed.
